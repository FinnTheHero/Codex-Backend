# Codex Backend

Backend for Codex - novel reader app.

# Details

Codex-Backend is built in `GoLang`, using `Gin` for server and `AWS-dynamoDB` for database.

It is deployed on `Heroku` (thats why the code is in api directory).

This will be updated later (the version before was already outdated)

### Run

- run server:
    ```bash
    go run api/cmd/codex/main.go
    ```
